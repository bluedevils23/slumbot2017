Not sure we can support in CFR+.  No efficient Showdown() method.

Results with p6ms3f1t1r1h5/mb1b1r3 look promising.

Note that the number of distinct betting sequences is much much less than
the number of exhaustive betting sequences.  Why is the tree file on disk
only a bit less than 10% of the size of the full tree?
Let's look at size of data files.
9.8 gigs for non-reentrant tree
5 gigs for reentrant tree
4.8 gigs for river non-reentrant tree
1 meg for river reentrant tree!

Do we only need reentrancy at street-initial nodes?  Maybe not.

Keying on:
  Street
  Player acting
  Bet to
  Last bet size
  Num players remaining
  Num players to act

Could I get rid of player acting?  Seems like it might be possible, but
it's not a sure thing.  If we're mostly merging at street-initial nodes,
does it matter?  Maybe we're not always merging at street-initial nodes.

Would like to more aggressively share when betting state is rarely reached.

Would like to more aggressively share when the reduction to the total tree
size is greater.  For example, more aggressively share on later streets.

Betting states with more bets are more rarely reached.
Betting states with more players are more rarely reached.

So we want a boolean function of street, num bets, num players.

Can I express such a function easily with params?

Could have 24 functions for every combination of street and num players.
The function just says: merge when number of bets is >= X.

What kind of size tree can we target?  Allow 1/4, 1/2, 1x and all-in
bet sizes?  Up to 5 bets per street?  Obviously will need very aggressive
sharing.

Should I tune bet sizes to maximize sharing?

Does an asymmetric system help?

Betting tree sizes:

mb1b1                River              5 megs
mb1b1                Turn, river        368k
mb1b2                Turn, river        1.3 megs
mb2b2                Turn, river        196 megs
mb2b2                Flop, turn, river  893k
mb3b3                Flop, turn, river  13 megs

Extra bet sizes doesn't add that much.  But an extra raise is huge.

Flop num nonterminals is by far the biggest.
