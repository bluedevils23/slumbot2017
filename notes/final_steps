Start 16g instance in us-east-1 (m5.xlarge?)
Copy code over; make restructure
Create 1 TB volume in same availability zone for raw trunk sumprobs data and
  raw river regrets for P1 system.
  Need all data for both players, right?
  Only needed 700 GB?  That's just for the source data.
  Need betting trees, num buckets files
Copy raw data from S3.  About one hour?
Create 200 GB volume for restructured data
  (Allow space for P0 and P1 asym systems.)
  One byte for preflop and flop sumprobs (divide by 4)
  Half byte for turn sumprobs (divide by 2)
  Two bits for river regrets (divide by 8)
  Better be less than 125 GB
  (34933829216 / 4) * 2 + (208558643592 / 8) * 2 + (100213288637 / 16) * 2 =
    82133236584 (82 gigs)
  Allocate 100 GB to be safe (times two for each system)
Mount into /data2; create links so that restructured data will be written
  into /data2
Make sure we have all the parameter files
Copy the static data
Run restructure (two hours?)
Save results to S3.
Do same for P0
Get rid of volume on /data

---------------------

Setting up test machine
Copy source, Makefile; build run_bot
Create 250 GB volume, attach, format, download restructured data there
scp ACPC code over, unpack in /data, make all
Copy parameter files to ACPC directory
  holdem_params, final_card_params, none_params, final_betting_params,
  mb1b1_params (?), tcfrq3p0_params, cfrps_params, runtime_params
Create go.slumbot script
